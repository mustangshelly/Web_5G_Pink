	<p> A tree Kangaroo may look a lot like regular kangaroos, but their arms and legs 
	are about the same length. Their arms and legs are very strong, so that they can 
	climb in the trees they live in. They are about 41-77 cm tall and they weigh up to 
	31 pounds., and have a tail that's as big as their body at 40-87 cm long! Thats a big
	 tail! </p>

	 <h2><b> Tree kangaroos Habitat </b> </h2>
	  <p>The tree Kangaroos usually live in the Montane tropical forest. These forest are 
	  in Indonesia,  Papua New guinea, and Australia. To try and protect these areas WWF 
	  (world wildlife fund) is managing, and promoting protected areas, they are raising 
	  awareness of habitat loss and the effects of hunting.They are also reducing illegal
	hunting with the help of TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring system.  </p>

	<!-- this is a paragraph about the endangerment of tree kangaroos --!> 
	
	<h2><b> Endangerment</b> </h2> 
	<p> The tree kangaroos have suffered from a loss of habitat  and uncontrolled hunting.
	  People hunt the tree kangaroos for their own food. The forests are getting removed 
	  also, which is not helping. They are getting removed, and coffee, and rice fields
	   are getting put in. Timber production, and lodging are also problems, with the 
	   decrease of the tropical forests. </p>
