				<h3>Is it Just a Baby Hippopotamus?</h3>
					<p>Although many people believe the Pygmy hippopotamus is a miniature version of the hippo, 
						they are incorrect. The two mammals differ in their physical characteristics and behaviors.
						Because he Pygmy hippo tends to spend less time in the water its head is rounder and narrower, 
						with a long neck and its eye are on the sides of its face, not on top. Its small body has longer 
						legs than their relatives, the elephants. Pygmy hippos only grow to be half as tall and weigh less
						than 1/4 than its cousin, the hippopotamus. The average full grown adults stand between <b>2.46 to 3.28 feet</b>
						and weigh anywhere between <b>397 to 606 pounds</b>. Due to the animal's nocturnalism, they were 
						not discovered until 1840 and little know about it habits in the wild. The Pygmy hippos rest
						during the day hidden away in swamps or rivers and later came out at night to eat during the cool
						hours of the night. Since they are herbivores their diet consists of leaves, roots, ferns, and fruits
						near rivers or streams. The Pygmy hippopotamus has a live expectancy of 27 years which is much shorter than their
						relatives, the hippopotamus, which is 50 years.</p>	
				<h3>Why is it Endangered?</h3>
					<p>These rare animals can be located in the interior forests in parts of West Africa, mainly in Liberia, but also
						found in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast. The World Conservation Union estimates fewer than 3,000 individuals 
						remaining in the wild. The Pygmy hippo is primarily being threatened due to the loss of their habitat. Since forests are being
						logged and converted to farmland, and war there are very little designated areas to give these animals shelter. The
						rivers they swim in are being polluted by human causing harm to the hippos. As forestes are shrinking, the
						population of these endangered hippos decreased leading to less diversity in the mating pool. They are also 
						very vulnerable to poaching, hunting for bushmeat, and natural predators. In Liberia, these hippos are among
						the species being illegally hunted for food. Unlike the common hippo, their large teeth have no value.

						<h3>Conservation</h3>
							<p class="p1">Luckily, Pygmy hippos breed very well in zoos, but more protection is required for the survival of this 
							wild populations so that they will not go extinct. In Switzerland, the Basel Zoo has the international breed registry book and 
							coordinates the entire population of captive freely breds around the world in the different zoos.The population of 
							the Pygmy hippos born in captivity nearly doubled between the years 1970 and 1991. According to the World Conservation Union this species
							has a greater chance of survival in zoo than in the wild. The Pygmy hippos in captivity live approximately 42 go 55 years 
							longer than in the wild. Recent study has shown that only 41% of all Pygmy born in zoos have been male since 1919. Liberia's Forestry 
							Development Authority and Fauna & Flora International had hosted a nation action planning meeting in December 2012 in which and Action
							Plan for the Conservation of the Pygmy Hippo in Liberia had been created. This plan adopts the same visions and goals as the Regional
							Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy and articulates objectives and actions necessary to attain those in Liberia. The Regional Pygmy Hippo 
							Conservation Strategy states that there are now conservation or research initiatives targeting Pygmy Hippos in all four West African countries. </p>
